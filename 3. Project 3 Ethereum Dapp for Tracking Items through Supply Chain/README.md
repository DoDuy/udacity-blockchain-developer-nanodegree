# Ethereum Dapp for Tracking Items through Supply Chain
For this project, I created a DApp supply chain solution backed by the Ethereum platform. I architected smart contracts that manage specific user permission controls as well as contracts that track and verify a productâ€™s authenticity.

## 1: Plan the project with write-ups
### Project write-up - UML
### Project write-up - Libraries
Library|Version|purpose
---|---|---
Truffle Version|5.5.6|compile, test, deploy smart contract
Node version|16.14.1|run Dapp website
@truffle/hdwallet-provider|2.0.4|provide WalletProvider to support connect truffle with infura
### Role
- Farmer: The Farmer can harvest coffee beans, process coffee beans, pack coffee palettes, add coffee palettes, ship coffee palettes, and track authenticity.
- Distributor: The Distributor can buy coffee palettes and track authenticity.
- Retailer: The Retailer can receive coffee palettes and track authenticity.
- Consumer: The consumer can buy coffee palettes and track authenticity.
### General Write Up
In this project, I have completed all the missing codes, tested as well as run the whole project.
I tested this project with all the steps on the local network because on the rinkeby test network I have very little ETH because it is difficult to request a lot of ETH, but I also successfully deployed the smart contract to the rinkeby test network.
Also in the web UI I have added a section to help add new users to make demo easier.
The final web UI is attached as below:

All tests are approved without error:
 ## 2: Deploy smart contract on a public test network (Rinkeby)
